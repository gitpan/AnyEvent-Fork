Revision history for Perl extension AnyEvent::Fork

TODO: maybe set child watcher?
TODO: AnyEvent::Fork::Pool

0.7  Thu Apr 18 22:16:26 CEST 2013
	- only set SIGCHLD to IGNORE while serving requests, reset
          it to the previous value after ->run.
        - minor docpatches.
        - mention AnyEvent::Fork::RPC, but not yte AnyEvent::Fork::Pool.

0.6  Sun Apr  7 00:41:30 CEST 2013
	- this release mostly updates the documentation.
	- add fork+exec replacement example to SYNOPSIS.
        - clarify some eval and run documentation.
        - defuse the documentation a bit - split synopsis into
          an example section, and rewor the problem statement.

0.5   Sat Apr  6 05:30:03 CEST 2013
	- set $SIG{CHLD} to IGNORE in processes forked to avoid
          accumulating zombies.
        - added "typical problems" section.
        - add some unscientific benchmark numbers to indicate relative
          performance.
        - post-benchmark socket writing optimisations :) (fewer syscalls,
          do more than one write per event loop iteration).

0.2   Fri Apr  5 21:07:59 CEST 2013
	- INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: AnyEvent::Fork::Template no longer exports
          anything and has renamed the variable.
	- do not leak the internal watcher as return value from run.
        - set $0 to run function name, tune existing $0 names as well.
        - work around a bug in openbsd file descriptor passing on at least
          4.5 and 4.8. might introduce a security problem on that platform.
        - switch to the new IO::FDPass module, which also fixes a bug
          with setting non-blocking mode and gives other improvements.
        - no longer an XS module.

0.01  Thu Apr  4 09:23:33 CEST 2013

0.00  Fri Mar 29 02:15:20 CET 2013
