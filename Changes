Revision history for Perl extension Proc::Pool

0.2   Fri Apr  5 21:07:59 CEST 2013
	- INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: AnyEvent::Fork::Template no longer exports
          anything and has renamed the variable.
	- do not leak the internal watcher as return value from run.
        - set $0 to run function name, tune existing $0 names as well.
        - work around a bug in openbsd file descriptor passing on at least
          4.5 and 4.8. might introduce a security problem on that platform.
        - switch to the new IO::FDPass module, which also fixes a bug
          with setting non-blocking mode and gives other improvements.
